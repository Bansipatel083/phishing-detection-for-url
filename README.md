# Phishing URL Detection Tool

Developed by **Bansi Patel**, this project is a machine learning-based tool designed to detect phishing URLs. It uses a combination of feature extraction and a Naive Bayes classifier to determine whether a given URL is phishing or legitimate. The tool is built using Python, Scikit-learn, Flask, and other essential libraries.

## **Introduction**
Phishing is a cybercrime where attackers attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by disguising themselves as trustworthy entities. This tool, created by Bansi Patel, helps detect such phishing attempts by analyzing the URLs using machine learning techniques.

## **Features**
- Detects phishing URLs using a trained machine learning model.
- User-friendly web interface for URL input and detection.
- Real-time predictions with a clear indication of whether the URL is phishing or not.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python 3.x**: Programming language used for the backend and machine learning model.
- **Flask**: Micro web framework for building the web interface.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for building and training the machine learning model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Joblib**: For saving and loading the trained model.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the web interface design.

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/phishing-url-detection.git
   cd phishing-url-detection
Create a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the Required Packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare the Dataset:

Place your dataset file (phishing_urls.csv) in the project directory.
The dataset should contain two columns: url and label (1 for phishing, 0 for legitimate).
Train the Model:

Run the training script to train the model and save it for later use:
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
This will generate the phishing_pipeline.pkl file containing the trained model.
Run the Flask Application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The application will start running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Open this URL in your browser to access the tool.
Usage
Open the web application in your browser.
Enter a URL in the input field and click "Check URL".
The application will display whether the URL is phishing or not.

Dataset
The dataset used for training should contain URLs labeled as phishing or non-phishing.
Sample format:
less
Copy code
url,label
http://secure-update-paypal.com/login,1
https://www.amazon.com,0
Make sure the dataset is clean and properly formatted before training the model.
How It Works
Data Preprocessing: URLs are vectorized using TfidfVectorizer, which converts them into numerical feature vectors.
Model Training: The MultinomialNB classifier is trained on these vectors to learn patterns indicative of phishing.
Prediction: When a new URL is input, it goes through the same vectorization process and is classified as either phishing or not.
Testing
Use both phishing and non-phishing URLs to test the tool's accuracy.
Example URLs:
Phishing: http://secure-update-paypal.com/login
Non-Phishing: https://www.amazon.com
